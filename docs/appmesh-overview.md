title: What's a Service Mesh?
---

App Mesh is a service mesh for controlling and monitoring your microservice communication on AWS.

It allows you to separate the logic needed to ensure reliable communication, apply traffic routing controls and policies, and monitoring support from your own application code. It does this by transforming simple declarative intentions and applying them to lightweight, high performance proxies that run alongside each of your microservices.

App Mesh has been designed to be independent of any specific container orchestration technology if you use containers for your microservices and to work across a variety of AWS compute services, including

* [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/)
* [Amazon Elastic Container Service \(ECS\)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/)
* [Amazon Elastic Kubenernetes Services \(EKS\)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/)
* [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)

App Mesh uses [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/), an open source proxy, making it compatible with a wide range of AWS partner and open source tools for monitoring microservices.
